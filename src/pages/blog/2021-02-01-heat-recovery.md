Greenfield projects are often faced with BREEAM accreditation which is measured in nine different categories: Management, Health & Wellbeing, Energy, Transport, Water, Materials, Waste, Land Use & Ecology and Pollution.

These credits accumulate to give a final score that determines your rating of:

**Pass** – **Good** – **Very Good** – **Excellent** – **Outstanding**.

This short note looks at the challenges of managing Energy and Water to meet the demands of BREEAM and delivering a sustainable operation. One third of all energy is consumed by industry with up to 50% of this wasted as heat.  The ability to harness waste heat through recovery systems is central to the design of processes for the Food & Beverage Industry. Our team at Engineer-iQ have supported Global Brand leaders to achieve an ‘Outstanding’ accreditation and sustainable ‘Carbon Neutral’ operation.

Thermal processes account for 70% of Industrial Energy use. Examples of heat recovery employed to reduce waste are:

* Heat regeneration in pasteurisers
* “Energy water” in cheese making and breweries
* Heat pump solutions in plants with heat/cool operations

Renewable energy sources, Solar and Wind provide an opportunity to replace conventional fuel boilers with Electrically powered systems. Built into a Micro Grid these systems return power to the National Grid in periods of low production.
Water used for purging and cleaning pipework can be replaced with more efficient product recovery systems. Membrane Filtration fractionation recovers material from water based interface streams for product recycling or base ingredients. The water stream is polished by Reverse Osmosis delivering potable water for CIP.

Measurement is key to identifying Energy and Water use, instrumentation to monitor and algorithms to calculate usage are easily retrofitted and most SCADA Historian modules are easily configured to provide baseline reports. Electricity metering is inexpensive and many of the larger motors installed are controlled using frequency converters that embed performance data – energy usage, operating hours, etc. Small reductions in the motor speed can yield considerable energy savings.

The Engineer-iQ team will audit your plant to identify waste heat sources and recommend solutions to recover the lost energy, reduce water usage. The audit will include an assessment of how the current control and automation systems can be enhanced to provide a platform for continuous improvement initiatives.
