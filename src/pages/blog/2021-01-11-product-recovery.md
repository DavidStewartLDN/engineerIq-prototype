Product at the end of a production sequence is recovered from pipework and heat exchangers using water or compressed air to push or purge the product forward into the product storage tank or a dedicated recovery tank.

* Preventing (or avoiding) waste and losses comes at a cost, however, this far outweighs the cost of processing rework or exporting waste from site.

* Product Recovery systems are employed to manage product interfaces, eliminating losses and product damage. 
* Membrane technology helps with concentrating recovered product for reworking into the process stream or generating higher value biproducts. Recovered water from these processes is polished and available for process & CIP applications.

For high value products that are not suitable for air or water purging the Food & Beverage industry has employed a technology from the Oil Industry called Pigging.

These technologies have limitations:

* Water purging introduces a mixing phase between product and water (particularly in heat exchangers). Depending on the amount of permissible water allowed in the product this can be an acceptable but not an ideal solution. Typical product recovery efficiency would be 60-75%. Metering systems and interface detection sensors are employed to eliminate mixing.
* Compressed air overcomes the issue of product dilution but suffers from low efficiency due to the tendency to bore through the central core of the product leaving product on pipe walls or heat exchange surfaces. Compressed air is also an expensive utility to generate. Typical product recovery efficiency would be 70-80%.
* Pigging systems utilise a solid projectile (slightly larger than the pipe diameter) that is pushed through the pipe using either water or compressed air. As it moves through the pipe, the pig pushes product ahead of it. Pigging cannot be used to recover product in valves or heat exchangers and it is not an easy technology to retrofit, often requiring long radius bends to allow the pigs to pass. However, product recovery efficiency in pipework can be as high as 98%.

# Fluivac

The Fluivac process overcomes many of the above issues. Fluivac uses high pressure and low volume of compressed air to remove the core product in the centre of pipework or heat exchangers and then follows on with a high flow low pressure air purge with a small amount of water injected into the air to give a scouring effect on the pipework surfaces leading to 95% of product recovery. Introduced through the CIP (Cleaning in Place) system pipework Fluivac can also be used to recover dilute cleaning detergents and acids between phases rather than using fresh water.
