Technology companies issue end of life warnings to users of their hardware and software products. Keeping technology current ensures access to spares, support and the ability to incorporate new features and releases.

Legacy system failures expose manufacturers to prolonged shutdown and limited access to support. Technology suppliers and their partners offer support contracts to ensure systems are up to date and can take advantage of upgrades.

EngineeriQ will audit your installation and will recommend an upgrade strategy identifying how to mitigate risks and minimize production downtime.
