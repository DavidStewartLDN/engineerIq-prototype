  High Availability Systems

  A highly available system should be able to quickly recover from any sort of failure state to minimize interruptions for the end user. Best practice for achieving high availability include:

  -	Elimination of single points of failure, or any node that would impact the system as a whole.

  -	Ensure that all systems and data are backed up for simple recovery.

  -	Use load balancing to distribute application and network traffic across servers or other hardware.

  -	Resource monitoring. For early failure detection.

  -	Distribute resources both geographically and functionally.

  Backups and failover processes are crucial components in accomplishing high availability. 

  Redundant Servers, Virtualisation and redundant ring networks are fundamental requirements to maintaining uptime. Failure of modern PLC’s is rare the control system architecture should take into account downtime required for maintenance and upgrades to the process. A solution employing PLC’s for each manufacturing cell is preferred to a single PLC controlling the whole process.
